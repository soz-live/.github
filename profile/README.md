# SOZ-LIVE

A CAD extension, written in Lisp.  

**SOZ-LIVE** is a collection of over 2600 Lisp routines, in around 30,000 lines of code, that combine to create a unform approach to using and coding within CAD packages such as BricsCAD and AutoCAD.


## SOZ - Scripted ObjectZ

### For Users

**SOZ** provides a consistent environment to develop complex CAD models, from a series of inputs of simpler objects using a Graphical User Interface (GUI).

It builds upon basic types such numbers and strings, to geometric objects such as vectors and points, to create entities such as Lines and Circles that enable the modelling of complex 3D Parts made of Features.


### For Coders

**SOZ** is Lisp programming with a twist, and a means to combine:

- Functional Programming 
- Object Oriented Programming
- and a Scripting Language

All programmed in Lisp.

Benefits of using the **SOZ** approach in programming include:

- Reduced code duplication.
- Ease of extending classes.
- Adding to the functionality of CAD. 
- Automated documentation of code.


## LIVE - Lisp Interactive Visual Environment

**LIVE** is a Node-based User Interface (UI) written in **SOZ** that enables the user to create visual models for iterative design.

The routines are built into the Core of **SOZ**, and consist of around 1000 lines of code.

**LIVE** objects, such as Nodes and Links, are created in PaperSpace while the modelling entities are created in ModelSpace.  This enables complex models and arrangements to be created, enabling iterative design of the models.
