# SOZ-LIVE

A CAD extension, written in Lisp.  

**SOZ-LIVE** is a collection of over 3400 Lisp routines, and around 30,000 lines of code, that combine to create a uniform approach to drafting, modelling and coding within CAD packages such as BricsCAD and AutoCAD.


## SOZ - Scripted ObjectZ

For Users, **SOZ** provides a consistent environment to develop complex CAD models, from a series of inputs of simpler objects using a Graphical User Interface (GUI).  
It builds upon basic types such numbers and strings, to geometric objects such as vectors and points, to create entities such as Curves and Solids that enable the modelling of complex 3D Parts made of Features.


For Coders, **SOZ** combines the best of Functional, Object-Oriented & Scripting languages, written entirely in Lisp.
With a structured and expressive approach to programming, **SOZ** gives creative power to Coders to extend and develop the project.  


## LIVE - Lisp Interactive Visual Environment

**LIVE** is a Node-based User Interface (UI) written in **SOZ** that enables the user to create visual models for iterative design.

The routines are built into the core of **SOZ**, and consist of around 1000 lines of code.


## Community

**SOZ-LIVE** aims to be a community for Users and Coders interested in developing the project to meet their needs and those of other uses of CAD who can benefit from the power and functionality provided.
